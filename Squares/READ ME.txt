Squares By Gilzean

I do not know whether this is a well known game or
not as I have only come across it once before
when I download it from somewhere and then 
lost it and was unable to find it again so I
decided to write it myself.

So while the idea is not mine - the code is.

Apologies for not commenting the code, I can't be
bothered, but variables and subs are aptly named
which should make it easy to follow.

** Note **
Code does include instruction 'Kill File'
This just deletes a temporary file that the
program creates to update the high scores.

My apologies for not knowing who wrote the one
that I downloaded but thanks for the idea.

The object of the game is to score as many points as
possible by removing coloured squares from the grid.
This is done by clicking on a square that is the same
colour as its neighbour (above, below, left or right)
All contiguously coloured squares in each direction 
will be removed and the squares above will drop down.
If this is not clear, right click a square to see which
will be removed. More points are scored for removing
lots of squares in one go and a bonus is scored for
completing a level.

Have fun, hope you enjoy.
